            <p>Hey There, </p>

            <p>
                I am John McGitney, Founder And CEO of Inside Real Estate. We are Canada's leading Real Estate company. We first started in the Year 1995. Since then, we have sold more than 1000 properties all over the country. We are also planning to expand to the United States next year. Our goal is to sell the property fast and at the rate that is reasonable. Not too high and not too low.
                <br /><br />
                Over the years, we have built a community of people who regularly buy and sell properties using our services and we are proud to admit that so far we have zero unhappy customers. As you will explore our portfolio, you will be able to see what our customers say about our services. Plus, if you are here to buy a property, you see some on our website that are listed for sale.
                <br /><br />
                All properties listed are inspected properly and come with our assurance. If there are any issues with the quality, we will refund the whole amount immediately. No further questions or attempts to negotiate. That's not a lie its our word.
                <br /><br />
                As a business, we put you the customer on our top priority and as a broker, we make sure that both the buyer and the seller stay happy with our services and that's why we have planned our services accordingly. Our services make sure that both buyers and sellers are getting the best quality at the most reasonable price there is. I hope you will choose us for your next purchase or sell.
                <br /><br />
                Thanks For Stopping By!
